# Known Bugs and Issues
This is a list of known issues in Wandersong! We are always working on fixes and regularly releasing patches. In the meantime, you can reference this page to work around any issues you may encounter. 

If you have an issue that you don't see listed here, **please let us know by twitter (@theBanov, @wandersong_Game) or by email (banovg@gmail.com)**

## General: PS4: Lose access to Scene Select after completing game
We're working on a patch for this, due in the near future! For the time being, each time you want to access Scene Select, you'll need to use the [[scene select code]](#scene-select-code). All of your other save data like postgame secrets and dances collected will stay. 

## General: The physics are erratic, collisions seem janky on PC
We find that the physics can be very erratic when the game is running at a low FPS. The game is very intensely optimized (it has to be to run on a Switch), but high resolution displays take a lot of processing power. If you are seeing erratic physics issues, consider playing in windowed mode, on a lower reoslution, and/or on a different display. Sorry!!!

## General: The bard's jump height is very low, platforming is difficult or impossible on PC
144Hz displays interact badly with the game physics, because they force the game into a higher framerate than it was made for. If you're experiencing this issue on a patched version of the game, we recommend turning V-Sync OFF in the Options. Toggling the V-Sync on and off can correct this issue as well. We've also been told turning "Stick to jump" OFF in "Controls" fixed it for some users. Alternatively, minimizing the game and using alt-tab to re-open it often corrects this issue.

## General (Mac): The bard turns pitch black after scene transitions
This is unfortunately an engine bug with Game Maker Studio. We've been working with Yoyogames to get it fixed, but progress has been slow. Until they address the issue, we can't do anything to improve the stability of this. You can help us push them on this by reaching to them on twitter, [[@Yoyogames]](https://twitter.com/yoyogames).

## ACT 5: Clipped through a wall in Mohabumi and can't get back to the other side
If you find yourself stuck behind a crystal wall, you can turn them transparent with a special song (sorry for the spoilers). You just need to sing Right, Down, Left.

# Scene Select code
If something is too frustrating or challenging, or another issue is blocking progress, there's a "Scene Select" that will let you jump to any section of the game, or re-load your current scene if you're encountering a bug. Scene Select is a feature normally unlocked after completing the game, and will even let you skip past areas. Use it wisely!

To unlock it, pause the game and open "Credits." Then press: 
On Swich: Left, Right, L, R, Up, Up, Down, Left, R, A.
On PS4: Left, Right, L, R, Up, Up, Down, Left, R, X.
On PC keyboard: Left, Right, Q, R, Up, Up, Down, Left, R, Space.

Once unlocked, it will be available on the pause menu in place of the "Credits" screen.
