# Known Bugs and Issues
This is a list of known issues in Wandersong! We are always working on fixes and regularly releasing patches. In the meantime, you can reference this page to work around any issues you may encounter. 

If you have an issue that you don't see listed here, **please let us know by twitter (@theBanov, @wandersong_Game) or by email (banovg@gmail.com)**

# Scene Select code
If something is too frustrating or challenging, or an unknown issue is blocking progress, there's a "Scene Select" that will let you jump to any section of the game, or re-load your current scene if you're encountering a bug. Scene Select is a feature normally unlocked after completing the game, and will even let you skip past areas. Use it wisely!

To unlock it, pause the game and open "Credits." Then press: 

On Swich: Left, Right, L, R, Up, Up, Down, Left, R, A.

On PS4 (input directions with left analog stick): Left, Right, L1, R1, Up, Up, Down, Left, R1, X.

On XBox (input directions with left analog stick): Left, Right, LB, RB, Up, Up, Down, Left, RB, A.

On PC keyboard: Left, Right, Q, R, Up, Up, Down, Left, R, Space.

Once unlocked, it will be available on the pause menu in place of the "Credits" screen.

## General: Mac: Crash when entering the factory in Act 4
If this is happening to you, there is a workaround! Right click the game in your Steam library > open Properties > the "Betas" tab > and select old-reliable from the build dropdown. This will switch you to an older version of the game where this crash doesn't seem to happen. This older build has other, different cosmetic issues, but it is otherwise stable. You should be able to switch back to the current build of the game after you are in Act 5.

## ACT 3: Crash when entering the cave room at the end of Turtle Shores
This is a known issue on consoles and will be fixed in our next patch! It happens if you reveal the Mermaid's Tear in the cave, and then leave without collecting it. Unfortunately there's no way to progress in this situation without using the Scene Select code above. If you are OK with replaying some of the game, you can use the Scene Select to reload the "Quest for the Mermaid's Tear" scene in Act 3, then re-collect the Tear pieces and continue as normal. You could also instead load the scene that follows it, but you will miss some story that happens after collecting the Mermaid Tears.

## ACT 3: Crash when talking to Markus on Tatango Island afer meeting mermaids
This is a known issue on consoles and will be fixed in our next patch! Here are the lines Markus would say in this situation:
> I've had time to reflect on the past.

> I regret that I was aggressive and out of control.

>...I'm sure it's the real reason my wife left.

> I know I don't deserve it...

> But I hope we can put my past actions behind us.

> I would rather be friends.

## ACT 5: Crash when fighting the boss in the forest
This is a known issue on consoles and will be fixed in our next patch! It happens only if you land the last (5th) hit on the boss at a time when Miriam is standing very close to one of the other witches. If you keep an eye on her and make sure they aren't standing near each other when you land an attack, you won't see the crash. Sorry about this!

## ACT 5: Clipped through a wall in Mohabumi and can't get back to the other side
If you find yourself stuck behind a crystal wall, you can turn them transparent with a special song (sorry for the spoilers). You just need to sing Right, Down, Left.

## XBox One: An achievement isn't unlocking
Different people seem to have this issue for different achievements, and we are not yet sure of the cause. If you've met the conditions for an achievement, restarting the game ought to run the checks again and reward you any unrewarded achievements. If this doesn't work, as a drastic option, you can open the game Options and delete your save data, then use the Scene Select code above to warp around the game and re-earn that achievement.

## General: PC: The physics are erratic, collisions seem janky
We find that the physics can be very erratic when the game is running at a low FPS. The game is very intensely optimized (it has to be to run on a Switch), but high resolution displays take a lot of processing power. If you are seeing erratic physics issues, consider playing in windowed mode, on a lower reoslution, and/or on a different display. The newest public build attempts to correct for these issues with the "auto-adjust" option, so make that is on and the game should optimize itself over the course of play.

## General: PC: The bard's jump height is very low, platforming is difficult or impossible
144Hz displays interact badly with the game physics, because they force the game into a higher framerate than it was made for. If you're experiencing this issue on a patched version of the game, we recommend turning V-Sync OFF in the Options. Toggling the V-Sync on and off can correct this issue as well. We've also been told turning "Stick to jump" OFF in "Controls" fixed it for some users. Alternatively, minimizing the game and using alt-tab to re-open it often corrects this issue.
